This code runs normally after downloading all the correct files one needs only to make sure that all the proper imports are downloaded and the datasets that end in .csv get inserted in the "datasets" directory for the code to properly run.

The program requires both the datasets "penguins.csv" and "abalone.csv" to function properly. A directory named "output" must also be present where the program is run.
